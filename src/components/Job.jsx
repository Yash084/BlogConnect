      "text": "<h1>About Us</h1><div>SegMetrics is a marketing analytics platform that’s focused on making marketing optimization a snap for digital marketers — now with 85% fewer pivot tables.<br><br>We’re a lean team of developers who are excited about data analytics and crunching numbers in new and interesting ways. While SegMetrics is a mature product, we’re always building new blue-sky features and products, which creates a lot of opportunities for building new, cool stuff.<br><br>We’re passionate about enabling digital marketers to better understand their leads, and more easily optimize their marketing funnels. We believe that marketers should have the best tools at their fingertips, and not need a degree in advanced statistics to make actionable marketing decisions.<br><br>We’re looking for an experienced, data-driven (or data-curious) full-stack developer to join us. This is a full-time, remote position with a flexible schedule, but we try to be available during main US business hours.<br><br>You might be a perfect fit if you’re someone who’s into marketing analytics, building new ways of looking at, and working with, data — or you like working with large amounts of data at scale.<br><br>In analytics, there are a hundred different ways to get the end result — if you’re someone who likes solving those types of puzzles, you’ll definitely fit in.<br><br></div><h1>About the Role</h1><div>We strive to make working at SegMetrics a unique experience where you can learn and grow in a fast-growing company. We have a team full of truly exceptional people who are fun to work with and at the top of their game. Here’s how we operate:<br><br><strong>Responsibility and Empowerment<br></strong><br>At SegMetrics, we appreciate, respect, and trust the expertise and judgment of our developers. We try our best to empower them to do what they think is right. <br><br>We also work collaboratively. We continuously seek the right amount of structure and unity necessary to maximize productivity. Where it makes sense, we designate someone to make a call. <br><br>Even though our developers are right a lot, it’s okay to make mistakes here. Exploration and calculated risks are vital to velocity and growth. We freely admit when we’re wrong. If something doesn’t go as expected, we learn, bounce back, and make corrections. <br><br>You won’t be alone; others will be there to help, review, reassure, and back you up. We own our processes and collective outcomes as a team.<br><br><strong>Live Where You Want<br></strong><br>We’re a distributed team, so you can live and work wherever you want, as long as it’s somewhere between the US Pacific and the Central European Time Zone. Proximity doesn’t influence productivity. Just make sure you have a reliable internet connection.<br><br><strong>No Crazy Hours<br></strong><br>We want everyone to have a full life outside of SegMetrics. We seldom work more than 40 hours per week. There have been rare occasions where things got a little crazy, and people logged some extra hours. But then they took additional time off to balance it all out. We work hard and smart, but we’re in this for the long haul; there’s no need to go crazy on the hours. We focus on what we get done, not how long we can sit in a chair.<br><br></div><h1>You, Our New Full Stack Developer</h1><div><strong>(that leans towards the backend)<br></strong><br>You’re a Full Stack developer with at least three years of experience building, shipping, monitoring, and maintaining Laravel SaaS apps at scale (not just websites). <br><br>Some client-side experience is required as a minimum, meaning you know enough HTML/CSS/some client-side framework to get stuff on the screen. We are a small, cross-functional team, and you will likely find yourself responsible for implementation on both the back end (Laravel and MySQL), as well as the front end (using Vue).<br><br>You have experience with servers and infrastructure, although you probably wouldn’t call yourself “dev ops.” You could help in architecting and maintaining scalable solutions.<br><br>You’ll do things like help vet and improve our server-side layer, implement new features, integrate with third-party APIs, and manage our application.<br><br><strong>Examples of things you might be working on at SegMetrics:<br></strong><br></div><ul><li>Integrating with 3rd party APIs like Email Service Providers, Payment Gateways, and Ad Platforms</li><li>Profiling our data importers to understand where bottlenecks are in our queue processes and acting on the information to reduce the server load</li><li>Helping improve our public and private APIs to make them easier for external and internal developers to use</li><li>Working with our database queries to make sure that our data collection and analytics are speedy for our customers</li><li>Adding new visualizations or report types to help customers better understand their marketing data</li><li>Updating behavior or adding a new UI component to our web app</li><li>Writing automated tests for new features or improving our existing test suites</li><li>Submitting and reviewing PRs in BitBucket, collaborating in Clubhouse, and jumping on a Slack call to get an extra pair of eyes on a gnarly bug</li></ul><div><br><strong>You’re the one we’re looking for if:<br></strong><br></div><ul><li>You are a full-stack developer, with&nbsp; 3+ years experience in PHP Laravel + Vue development as well as experience with building analytical queries in MySQL</li><li>You are passionate about analytics and data sleuthing&nbsp;</li><li>You enjoy a challenge, and figuring out how to solve problems in a way that helps all customers, not just an individual problem</li><li>You are eager to learn new things</li><li>We’re looking for someone who is eager to learn new things and is interested in the MarTech space, and the problems that they encounter. You’ll do well with SegMetrics if you are proactive about solving problems, and can function well with minimal oversite, working in a fully-remote team.</li><li>We want you to keep a good work-life balance. We do not expect “butts in seats” but are focused on consistently completing objectives &amp; shipping solid code.</li></ul><div><br><strong>You probably aren’t the one we’re looking for if:<br></strong><br></div><ul><li>You need to be told what to work on next (No shame on this.

We’re not looking for amazing, but better than purple-and-orange-buttons-on-green-background.<br><br></li></ul><h1>Benefits</h1><ul><li>Competitive salary</li><li>Health, vision, and dental</li><li>Family-friendly, flexible ways of working</li><li>Fully remote arrangement (we have no “head office”)</li><li>Join a rapidly growing tech company</li></ul><div><br>At SegMetrics, we strongly believe in diversity and equality and thus encourage people from all backgrounds, abilities, experiences, and ages to apply.<br><br>SegMetrics’s policies and practices relating to recruitment, employment, career development, and advancement, promotion, and retirement are based solely on merit, regardless of race, color, religion, ancestry, sex (including pregnancy, lactation, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression), national origin, age, citizenship, marital status, mental or physical disability, genetic information (including family medical history), discharge status from the military, protected veteran status (which includes disabled veterans, recently separated veterans, active duty wartime or campaign badge veterans, and Armed Forces service medal veterans), or any other basis protected by law.
